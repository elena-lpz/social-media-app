# Requirements

This week I achieved all the requirements and some stretch goals like:

- Use of Typescript
- Edit profile feature
- Delete post feature
- Dropdown form for book status
- I am sure I'm forgetting something...

# Design

It was a bit hard to decide on the design direction I wanted for my app, especially since it changed from being a social media app similar to Instagram to something completely different. I ended up settling on a dark theme with bright accent colours, no real reason other than I thought it looked cool.

I also added an ad that does nothing. It was in the designs, so I figured I should include it somewhere. Ideally, I would’ve built it properly in code rather than just using an image, but it was a last-minute addition and I didn’t have time.

All designs are in the design folder.

# I did not achieve

I had a lot of ideas for this app, but as always, time is limited and there’s only so much I can do in 2 or 3 days. I didn’t get to implement everything I had in mind, especially design-wise (so the app might look a bit different from the original designs), and I had to skip features like visiting other users’ profiles, setting up reading challenges, or adding books from other users’ shelves.

Overall, I’m happy with what I managed to build, and maybe in the future, I can add everything I originally envisioned.

Edit: Editing to include more stuff I did not have time to complete... I would have liked to add a button to view book info, I also wanted to include a summary row in my table but ideally, I would have liked to use an API to get this data from, so the user would only need to search for a book and the data pulled from the API would fill out the rest, the only thing the user would need to do is change the status, add a review and rating. 

# Challenges

TypeScript. TypeScript. TypeScript. I struggled a lot with the errors, but I got through it in the end. I also ran into some deployment issues that felt impossible to fix at the time, but again, here we are.

# Resources

Tried to put all the links in the code itself but I might have forgotten some...
